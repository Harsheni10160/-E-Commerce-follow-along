# Ecommerce Follow Along Project
 Welcome to the **Ecommerce Follow Along Project**, this is a hands-on project where we will build a complete e-commerce application using the MERN stack (MongoDB , Express.js,React.js,and Node.js). The goal is to learn how to develop a full-stack web application step by step.


 ## Milestone  1: Project Overview

 #### 1.Understanding the MERN Stack:
  **MongoDB :** A database for storing application data in a flexible,document based format.
  **Express.js :** A backend web application framework for building API's and handling server logics.
  **React.js :** A framework library for building user Interfaces.
  **Node.js :** A runtime environment that allows javascript to run on the server.

  #### 2. REST API Stucture
  REST API's are used to allow communication between the frontend and backend.
  We'll create API's for :
  **User Authentication**:Allowing users to register and log in.
  **Product Management**:Adding,updating and retrieving product data.
  **Order Handling**:Managing customer orders.

  #### 3.Database Schema Design
  We'll learn how to design and organize data using MongoDB. A schema helps us define how the data is stored and related.


  #### 4. Authentication
Authentication ensures only the right people can access certain features. For example: - 
-Users need to log in to place orders or see their personal data.
-It keeps the app secure by verifying users'Â identities.

# ⭐ Ecommerce Follow Along Project ⭐

Welcome to the Ecommerce Follow Along Project! This hands-on project focuses on building a complete e-commerce application using the *MERN stack* (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). The goal is to learn how to develop a full-stack web application step by step.

- *Express.js*: A backend web application framework for building APIs and handling server logic.
- *React.js*: A framework/library for building user interfaces.
- *Node.js*: A runtime environment that allows JavaScript to run on the server.

### 🌟 M2. REST API Structure
- *User Authentication*: Allowing users to register and log in.
- *Product Management*: Adding, updating, and retrieving product data.
- *Order Handling*: Managing customer orders.

### 🌟 M3. Database Schema Design
- Learn how to design and organize data using MongoDB.
- Define schemas to store and manage data relationships.
